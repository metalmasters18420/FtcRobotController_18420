## Simple Examples Package

Welcome!

These are some simple opmodes that should work on a robot with only a few connected devices.
    2 Drive Motors
    1 Lift Motor
    1 or 2 Claw Servos

The intention of these examples is to demonstrate a pared down look at some of the example opmodes
and they can be run on the test robot and modified from that point.  Please do not edit these!
Only copy them and edit them.
